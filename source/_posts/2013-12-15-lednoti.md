Code can control the LED notification in Android device, using android.app.Notification:

{% code %}
notification = new Notification();  
notification.flags = Notification.FLAG_SHOW_LIGHTS;  
  
notification.ledARGB = ledColor;  
notification.ledOffMS = 200;  
notification.ledOnMS = 500;  
  
notificationManager.notify(0, notification);  
{% endcode %}

ledARGB: The color of the led. The hardware will do its best approximation.

ledOffMS: The number of milliseconds for the LED to be off while it's flashing. The hardware will do its best approximation.

ledOnMS: The number of milliseconds for the LED to be on while it's flashing. The hardware will do its best approximation.

<!-- more -->

Notice, above 3 parameters are all explained as <b>"The hardware will do its best approximation"</b>. 

In my Phone, ZTE U5, it seems that only Color.Red, Color.Green and Color.Yellow are supported. Color.Blue, Color.White and others doesn't work.

Notification.FLAG_SHOW_LIGHTS references:

Since hardware varies, you are not guaranteed that any of the values you pass are honored exactly. Use the system defaults (TODO) if possible because they will be set to values that work on any given hardware.

So it's better to use : notification.defaults = Notification.DEFAULT_LIGHTS;
